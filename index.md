## Intro

3-D City Of Chicago with lighting 


### Markdown

This is the class project that I built for Intro to Computer Graphics class. This project is using webGL to draw 3D world on the canvas in a HTML browser(Google Chrome is preferred). We draw two 3D worlds, left screen is draw with perspective view, and the right screen is orthogonal view, but both have the same camera view as we moving and rotation the camera position. Open up the html file called: HuangZhen_HongLei_ProjC.htlm , and you will see a basic instructions of how to control and interact with the 3D world, including keyboard inputs, user input as shown below:
